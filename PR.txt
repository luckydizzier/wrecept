Title: docs: document validation strategy

Problem:
Architecture decisions lacked guidance on input validation and progress logs were outdated.

Approach:
Added a validation strategy section and recorded milestone progress.

Alternatives considered:
None.

Risk & mitigations:
Validation details could overlap with error handling; section kept concise and focused.

Affected files:
- docs/architecture-decisions.md
- docs/progress/2025-08-12_06-37-55_master-orchestrator.md

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- `dotnet build Wrecept.Core.sln`
- `dotnet test Wrecept.Core.Tests`
- `dotnet test tests/Wrecept.Domain.Tests`

Refs: Milestone 5
