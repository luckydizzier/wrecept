Title: services: add invoice creation and TUI flow

Body:

Problem:
No invoice creation logic or wizard existed, so VAT totals couldn't be computed.

Approach:
Implemented `InvoiceService` for VAT snapshot and totals, added `new_invoice` wizard leveraging `DateField` and `EditFormController`, and covered totals with a unit test.

Alternatives considered:
Deferring the TUI until full persistence was rejected to keep vertical slice progress.

Risk & mitigations:
Wizard currently lacks advanced validation; future iterations will refine UX.

Affected files:
- src/facturon_py/services/__init__.py
- src/facturon_py/services/invoice_service.py
- src/facturon_py/ui_tui/invoice_flow.py
- src/facturon_py/ui_tui/__init__.py
- tests/test_invoice_service.py

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- `pip install -r src/facturon_py/requirements.txt`
- `ruff check src/facturon_py tests`
- `black src/facturon_py tests`
- `pytest`
