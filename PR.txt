Title: docs: add localization strategy

Problem:
Documentation missed localization guidance and progress log for Milestone 5.

Approach:
Added localization strategy section and logged related progress.

Alternatives considered:
None.

Risk & mitigations:
Documentation may fall out of sync with code; keep docs updated during feature work.

Affected files:
- docs/architecture-decisions.md
- docs/progress/2025-08-11_13-42-06_master_orchestrator.md

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- `dotnet build Wrecept.Core.sln`
- `dotnet test Wrecept.Core.Tests`
- `dotnet test tests/Wrecept.Domain.Tests`
