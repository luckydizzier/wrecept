Title: docs: document progress log naming pattern

Body:

Problem:
Progress logs lacked a documented naming convention and corresponding progress entry for Milestone 5.

Approach:
Added the naming pattern to `docs/architecture-decisions.md` and created a matching progress log.

Alternatives considered:
None.

Risk & mitigations:
Potential divergence from style guidelines; cross-checked with `docs/styleguide.md`.

Affected files:
- docs/architecture-decisions.md
- docs/progress/2025-08-11_01-00-00_master_orchestrator.md
- SUMMARY.md
- PR.txt
- LIMITS.txt

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- dotnet build Wrecept.Core.sln
- dotnet test Wrecept.Core.Tests/Wrecept.Core.Tests.csproj
- dotnet test tests/Wrecept.Domain.Tests/Wrecept.Domain.Tests.csproj
