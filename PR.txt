Title: docs: require task references in progress logs

Problem:
Progress logs did not explicitly link entries to their related tasks or milestones.

Approach:
Added an architecture decision mandating task references in progress logs and recorded a corresponding progress entry.

Alternatives considered:
None.

Risk & mitigations:
Documentation practices may still be overlooked â†’ treat missing references as bugs during review.

Affected files:
- docs/architecture-decisions.md
- docs/progress/2025-08-11_13-35-14_master_orchestrator.md
- SUMMARY.md
- PR.txt
- LIMITS.txt

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- `dotnet build Wrecept.Core.sln`
- `dotnet test Wrecept.Core.Tests`
- `dotnet test tests/Wrecept.Domain.Tests`
