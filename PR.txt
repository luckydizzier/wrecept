Title: docs: document error handling strategy

Body:

Problem:
New error handling documentation and progress log required style alignment.

Approach:
Added an "Error Handling Strategy" section with present-tense bullet points and logged the update.

Alternatives considered:
None.

Risk & mitigations:
Misinterpreting documentation style; cross-checked against `docs/styleguide.md`.

Affected files:
- docs/architecture-decisions.md
- docs/progress/2025-08-11_00-47-40_master_orchestrator.md
- SUMMARY.md
- PR.txt
- LIMITS.txt

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- dotnet build Wrecept.Core.sln
- dotnet test Wrecept.Core.Tests
- dotnet test tests/Wrecept.Domain.Tests
