Title: docs: clarify cross-platform build strategy

Body:

Problem:
Cross-platform build guidance did not clearly state how to build on non-Windows hosts.

Approach:
Refined the build strategy in `docs/architecture-decisions.md` and recorded the update in a progress log.

Alternatives considered:
None.

Risk & mitigations:
Instructions may become outdated; review periodically as tooling evolves.

Affected files:
- docs/architecture-decisions.md
- docs/progress/2025-08-11_13-15-14_master_orchestrator.md
- SUMMARY.md
- PR.txt
- LIMITS.txt

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- dotnet build Wrecept.Core.sln
- dotnet test Wrecept.Core.Tests/Wrecept.Core.Tests.csproj
- dotnet test tests/Wrecept.Domain.Tests/Wrecept.Domain.Tests.csproj
