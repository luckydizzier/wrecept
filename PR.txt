Title: ui: add localized date input widget

Body:

Problem:
Date editors accepted free-form strings without locale awareness.

Approach:
Added `DateField` with locale-based masks, validation, and ISO normalization.

Alternatives considered:
Using external libraries like Babel was deemed unnecessary for MVP.

Risk & mitigations:
Limited locale support; ISO fallback ensures consistent storage.

Affected files:
- src/facturon_py/ui_tui/widgets/date_field.py
- src/facturon_py/ui_tui/widgets/__init__.py
- tests/test_date_field.py

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- `ruff check src/facturon_py tests`
- `black src/facturon_py tests`
- `pytest`
