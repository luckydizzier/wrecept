Title: ci/docs: conditional build & tests script

Body:

Problem:
Root build/test script failed when WindowsDesktop SDK was missing.

Approach:
Move build/test logic to `docs/COMMANDS.sh` and skip UI steps if `windowsdesktop` workload is absent.

Alternatives considered:
Keep root `COMMANDS.sh` and instruct users to install WindowsDesktop.

Risk & mitigations:
UI coverage skipped on non-Windows environments; Windows CI required.

Affected files:
- docs/COMMANDS.sh
- SUMMARY.md
- PR.txt
- LIMITS.txt
- COMMANDS.sh (removed)

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- bash docs/COMMANDS.sh
