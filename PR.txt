Title: facturon_py: scaffold package

Body:

Problem:
- No Python package existed for Facturon-Py MVP.

Approach:
- Created base package with README, requirements, and smoke test.

Alternatives considered:
- Scaffold full module tree in one step (deferred to stay within limits).

Risk & mitigations:
- Python and .NET overlap; isolated new code under src/facturon_py.

Affected files:
- src/facturon_py/__init__.py
- src/facturon_py/AGENTS.md
- src/facturon_py/README.md
- src/facturon_py/requirements.txt
- tests/test_environment.py

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- ruff check src/facturon_py tests
- black src/facturon_py tests/test_environment.py
- pytest tests/test_environment.py
