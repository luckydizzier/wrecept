Title: docs: document .NET environment checks

Body:

Problem:
Needed to verify .NET installation and ensure `COMMANDS.sh` resides under `docs/`.

Approach:
Ran `dotnet --info`, `dotnet workload list`, and executed `docs/COMMANDS.sh`; recorded outcomes in `docs/CHECKLIST.md`.

Alternatives considered:
None.

Risk & mitigations:
UI tests remain skipped without the `windowsdesktop` workload; rely on Windows CI.

Affected files:
- docs/COMMANDS.sh
- docs/CHECKLIST.md
- SUMMARY.md
- PR.txt
- LIMITS.txt

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- dotnet --info
- dotnet workload list
- bash docs/COMMANDS.sh
