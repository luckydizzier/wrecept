Title: docs: add next actions to audit progress

Body:

Problem:
Milestones in `docs/AUDIT_PROGRESS.md` lacked guidance on next steps.

Approach:
Inserted a `Next Action:` line after each milestone entry.

Alternatives considered:
Leaving progress log unchanged.

Risk & mitigations:
Build failed due to missing WindowsDesktop SDK; note dependency in documentation.

Affected files:
- docs/AUDIT_PROGRESS.md

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- dotnet build wrecept.sln (failed â€“ WindowsDesktop SDK missing)
- dotnet test wrecept.sln (passed for Domain/Core; UI tests skipped)
