Title: docs: add documentation strategy and log entry

Body:

Problem:
Architecture decisions lacked a documentation strategy and the progress log required an update.

Approach:
Appended a documentation strategy section, created a timestamped progress log, and verified build and tests.

Alternatives considered:
None.

Risk & mitigations:
Progress log naming could be inconsistent; timestamp verified before commit.

Affected files:
- docs/architecture-decisions.md
- docs/progress/2025-08-11_00-31-27_master_orchestrator.md
- COMMANDS.sh
- SUMMARY.md
- PR.txt
- LIMITS.txt

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- dotnet build Wrecept.Core.sln
- dotnet test Wrecept.Core.Tests
- dotnet test tests/Wrecept.Domain.Tests
