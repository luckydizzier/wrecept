Title: ui: add accessible status markers

Body:

Problem:
- Invoice status relied on color alone, excluding screen readers and color-blind users.

Approach:
- Added InvoiceStatus enum with marker/description helpers.
- Bound status markers in list and detail views with accessible text.

Alternatives considered:
- Dedicated value converters (deferred).

Risk & mitigations:
- Colors are hard-coded; future theming may require refactor.

Affected files:
- Wrecept.Core/Models/Invoice.cs
- Wrecept.UI/ViewModels/InvoiceViewModel.cs
- Wrecept.UI/Views/ListsView.xaml
- Wrecept.UI/Views/InvoiceView.xaml
- Wrecept.Core.Tests/InvoiceTests.cs

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- dotnet build wrecept.sln
- dotnet test wrecept.sln
