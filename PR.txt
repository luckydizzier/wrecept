Title: docs: add repository audit

Body:

Problem:
Lack of a centralized overview of codebase structure, testing state, and dependency health.

Approach:
Compiled AUDIT.md summarizing architecture, test coverage, documentation, dependencies, and risks.

Alternatives considered:
Direct code fixes without audit—rejected to maintain scope.

Risk & mitigations:
Audit reflects environment lacking WindowsDesktop SDK; recommend configuring Windows tooling to validate UI layers.

Affected files:
- AUDIT.md

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- dotnet build wrecept.sln (failed – WindowsDesktop SDK missing)
- dotnet test Wrecept.Core.Tests/Wrecept.Core.Tests.csproj (passed)
- dotnet test tests/Wrecept.Domain.Tests/Wrecept.Domain.Tests.csproj (passed)
- dotnet test Wrecept.UI.Tests/Wrecept.UI.Tests.csproj (failed – missing WindowsDesktop targets)
- dotnet test tests/Wrecept.UI.AutomatedTests/Wrecept.UI.AutomatedTests.csproj (no tests discovered)
- dotnet list Wrecept.Core/Wrecept.Core.csproj package --outdated (reported available updates)
