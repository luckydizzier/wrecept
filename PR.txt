Title: ui: confirm and audit active toggle

Body:

Problem:
- Active status could be flipped without warning or trace.

Approach:
- Added confirmation dialog and audit logging when toggling active.
- Introduced undo via Ctrl+Z with audit entry.

Alternatives considered:
- Persistent audit database (postponed for MVP).

Risk & mitigations:
- Undo stack limited to recent toggle; further enhancements may be needed.

Affected files:
- src/facturon_py/repo/audit_log.py
- src/facturon_py/ui_tui/edit_views/edit_form.py
- tests/test_edit_form_controller.py

Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- black src/facturon_py tests
- ruff check src/facturon_py tests
- pytest
