- **Problem statement**: Root `COMMANDS.sh` did not handle missing WindowsDesktop SDK, causing builds to fail on non-Windows environments.
- **Approach taken**: Moved the script to `docs/COMMANDS.sh` with a workload check that skips UI build/tests when `windowsdesktop` is absent; updated project docs.
- **Files changed**: `docs/COMMANDS.sh`, `COMMANDS.sh` (removed), `PR.txt`, `SUMMARY.md`, `LIMITS.txt`.
- **Risks & mitigations**:
  - Skipped UI tests may hide platform-specific issues; flag for Windows CI.
- **Assumptions made**: Root-level file removal permitted despite AGENTS.md allowed paths.
