- **Problem statement**: Architecture decisions lacked a documentation strategy and progress logs needed an entry for this update.
- **Approach taken**: Added a "Documentation Strategy" section, created a timestamped progress log, and ran build and test commands.
- **Files changed**: `docs/architecture-decisions.md`, `docs/progress/2025-08-11_00-31-27_master_orchestrator.md`, `COMMANDS.sh`, `SUMMARY.md`, `PR.txt`, `LIMITS.txt`.
- **Risks & mitigations**:
  - Progress log naming mistakes could break chronology; verified timestamp format before commit.
- **Assumptions made**: Output contract files are permitted at repository root and excluded from file-count limits.
