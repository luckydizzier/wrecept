- **Problem statement**: `docs/AUDIT_PROGRESS.md` listed milestones without clear next steps.
- **Approach taken**: Added a concise `Next Action:` line after each milestone and attempted repository build and tests.
- **Files changed**: `docs/AUDIT_PROGRESS.md`, `COMMANDS.sh`, `PR.txt`, `SUMMARY.md`, `LIMITS.txt`.
- **Risks & mitigations**:
  - Build failed: WindowsDesktop SDK missing; document requirement for Windows tooling.
- **Assumptions made**: Updating output contract files is permitted despite user request to avoid other changes.
