- **Problem statement**: Newly added documentation required style alignment.
- **Approach taken**: Added an "Error Handling Strategy" section and recorded a matching progress log entry, then verified build and tests.
- **Files changed**: `docs/architecture-decisions.md`, `docs/progress/2025-08-11_00-47-40_master_orchestrator.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, `PR.txt`, `LIMITS.txt`.
- **Risks & mitigations**:
  - Misinterpreting style conventions â†’ reviewed `docs/styleguide.md` before editing.
- **Assumptions made**: Existing `COMMANDS.sh` remains valid and unchanged.
