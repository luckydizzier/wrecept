- **Problem statement**: Progress logs lacked explicit references to their related tasks or milestones.
- **Approach taken**: Added an architecture decision requiring task references in progress logs and logged the update.
- **Files changed**: `docs/architecture-decisions.md`, `docs/progress/2025-08-11_13-35-14_master_orchestrator.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, `PR.txt`, `LIMITS.txt`.
- **Risks & mitigations**:
  - Future logs might omit task references â†’ treat missing references as documentation bugs during review.
- **Assumptions made**: Existing progress log format remains acceptable.
