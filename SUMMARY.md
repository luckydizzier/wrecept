Problem: Architecture decisions lacked a validation strategy and progress logs were outdated.
Approach: Added a dedicated validation strategy section and recorded a milestone progress entry.
Files changed:
  - docs/architecture-decisions.md
  - docs/progress/2025-08-12_06-37-55_master-orchestrator.md
Risks & mitigations:
  - Potential overlap with error handling guidance; kept validation notes concise to avoid duplication.
Assumptions:
  - Existing validation mechanisms match documented strategy.
