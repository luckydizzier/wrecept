- Problem: Documentation lacked localization strategy and recent progress entry.
- Approach: Added localization strategy section to architecture decisions and logged progress for Milestone 5.
- Files changed:
  - docs/architecture-decisions.md
  - docs/progress/2025-08-11_13-42-06_master_orchestrator.md
- Risks & mitigations:
  - Localization guidelines may require refinement as implementation evolves; keep documentation synced with code.
- Assumptions:
  - Output contract files are exempt from file-count limits.
