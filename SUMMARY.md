- **Problem statement**: Cross-platform build guidance lacked clear instructions for non-Windows hosts.
- **Approach taken**: Expanded the build strategy in `docs/architecture-decisions.md` and logged the change in a new progress entry. Verified build and tests.
- **Files changed**: `docs/architecture-decisions.md`, `docs/progress/2025-08-11_13-15-14_master_orchestrator.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, `PR.txt`, `LIMITS.txt`.
- **Risks & mitigations**:
  - Guidance may become outdated as build tooling evolves â†’ periodically review documentation.
- **Assumptions made**: Existing build commands remain valid across environments.
