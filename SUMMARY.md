- **Problem statement**: Milestone 5 requires documenting progress log naming and recording the update.
- **Approach taken**: Added the required naming pattern to `docs/architecture-decisions.md` and logged the change in a new progress entry. Verified build and tests.
- **Files changed**: `docs/architecture-decisions.md`, `docs/progress/2025-08-11_01-00-00_master_orchestrator.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, `PR.txt`, `LIMITS.txt`.
- **Risks & mitigations**:
  - Possible deviation from future naming policies â†’ referenced style guide for consistency.
- **Assumptions made**: Timestamp `01-00-00` chosen to satisfy naming convention.
